# Multi-Agent-LSTMTD3
Python Code for MA-LSTMTD3 algorithm 

## Description ( brief overview of the project and its purpose:summary of the associated paper its objectives and contributions)
To run three deterministic algorithms for multi-agent reinforcement learning:

1.MA-DDPG
2.MA-TD3
3.MA-LSTMTD3
For both Markov Decision Processes(MDP) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) versions of the tasks.
The specific environments are the PettingZoo Multi-Particle Environments (MPE Environments):

1.simple_adversary_v3
2.simple_spread_v3
3.simple_speaker_listener_v4
