# Description

I placed all my utility code in this directory.

## File: data_manager.py

This is my class filled with reusable code for exporting data plots to .png files and data to .csv files.

## File: dynamic_array.py

Python does not have a native, efficient dynamic array class. I wrote a simple 1D dynamic array class that uses Numpy and is more efficient for appending elements to arrays that can grow and shrink their memory storage sizes.
